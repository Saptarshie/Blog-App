## Bugs
- On uploading new blog , the thumbnail image is not showing unless server is restarted.
- Subscription payment history tracker is not yet implemented ,...hence users can double-count payments (probably a request-id based / random-disposable wallet based payments will be implemented in future)

- Integrate Gemini/OpenRouter for search-summary and as content-creation assistant.
